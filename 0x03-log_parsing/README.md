0x03. Log Parsing

#introduction:
Log parsing is the process of systematically analyzing log data generated by software applications, servers, and other IT systems to extract meaningful information. These logs record various events, transactions, errors, and other pertinent activities that occur within the system. By parsing these logs, organizations can identify patterns, diagnose issues, monitor system performance, and ensure security compliance. Effective log parsing transforms raw, unstructured log data into structured, actionable insights, enabling better decision-making and efficient troubleshooting. This practice is crucial for maintaining the health, security, and reliability of IT infrastructures.
