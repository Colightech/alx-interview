# introduction
0x05 nqueens is a classic computer science problem that involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem is a well-known example of backtracking algorithms, where the solution involves exploring all possible configurations of queens and backtracking when a conflict is detected. The n-queens problem not only serves as an interesting puzzle but also illustrates key concepts in algorithm design and computational problem-solving.
