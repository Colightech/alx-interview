# introduction
0x01 Lockboxes are a novel concept in secure storage solutions, designed to offer a blend of robust protection and accessibility. These lockboxes, often employing cryptographic techniques, provide a secure repository for sensitive information, digital assets, or physical items. Their name, "0x01," signifies their digital nature, rooted in the hexadecimal numbering system commonly used in computing. By leveraging encryption algorithms and advanced security protocols, 0x01 Lockboxes ensure that only authorized individuals can access their contents, safeguarding against unauthorized intrusion or theft. This innovative approach to secure storage addresses the growing need for reliable protection in an increasingly digital world, making them a valuable asset for individuals and organizations seeking to safeguard their most valuable assets.

# Question:
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)
boxes is a list of lists
A key with the same number as a box opens that box
You can assume all keys will be positive integers
There can be keys that do not have boxes
The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False
